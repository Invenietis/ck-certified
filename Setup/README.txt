In order to localize CiviKey you need to add al.exe (Assembly Linker) into your environment variables(Path).
Reason : Localized BAML and compiled resx use the same name (dllname.resources.dll), so generating the BAML tends to overwrite the compiled resx files.
the assemly linker enables us to merge the two resources into a single final assembly (see WPFLocalizationGuidance.pdf which can be found in the same folder as this README.txt).
